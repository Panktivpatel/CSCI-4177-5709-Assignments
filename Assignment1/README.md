<h1>Deployment</h1>
<p>
Initially, I created a git repository and cloned it. Then I installed <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html">React.js</a> and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> in my project along with bootstrap. <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> helps in creating responsive website and react.js makes code working efficiently. 
<br/>
Then, I developed the webpage (it is not working with functionality) just the basic UI was developed. Thenafter, I connected netlify to my gi repository. I deployed the app on Netlify.com. Once the deployment was complete, I was able to access my webpage using the provided link.
